# Light Pollution Analysis

I've always been curious about space and astronomy related topics, so it made me quite disappointed to find out that we can't see the stars in Singapore due to light pollution. I created this project to learn more about light pollution, why it occurs, and explore ways to reduce it.

## Features 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization and analysis

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Tableau

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyiokoi/Light-down-Singapore.git
cd LightPollution
jupyter notebook notebooks/datacleaning.ipynb
